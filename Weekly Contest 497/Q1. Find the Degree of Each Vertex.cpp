/*You are given a 2D integer array matrix of size n x n representing the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph with n vertices labeled from 0 to n - 1.

matrix[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an edge between vertices i and j.
matrix[i][j] = 0 indicates that there is no edge between vertices i and j.
The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.

Return an integer array ans of size n where ans[i] represents the degree of vertex i.

 

Example 1:



Input: matrix = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]]

Output: [2,2,2]*/
