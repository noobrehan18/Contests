/*You are given a 2D integer array towers, where towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi] represents the coordinates (xi, yi) and quality factor qi of the ith tower.

You are also given an integer array center = [cx, cy​​​​​​​] representing your location, and an integer radius.

A tower is reachable if its Manhattan distance from center is less than or equal to radius.

Among all reachable towers:

Return the coordinates of the tower with the maximum quality factor.
If there is a tie, return the tower with the lexicographically smallest coordinate. If no tower is reachable, return [-1, -1].
The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
A coordinate [xi, yi] is lexicographically smaller than [xj, yj] if xi < xj, or xi == xj and yi < yj.

|x| denotes the absolute value of x.

 

Example 1:

Input: towers = [[1,2,5], [2,1,7], [3,1,9]], center = [1,1], radius = 2

Output: [3,1]

Explanation:

Tower [1, 2, 5]: Manhattan distance = |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1, reachable.
Tower [2, 1, 7]: Manhattan distance = |2 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 1, reachable.
Tower [3, 1, 9]: Manhattan distance = |3 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 2, reachable.
All towers are reachable. The maximum quality factor is 9, which corresponds to tower [3, 1].

Example 2:

Input: towers = [[1,3,4], [2,2,4], [4,4,7]], center = [0,0], radius = 5

Output: [1,3]

Explanation:

Tower [1, 3, 4]: Manhattan distance = |1 - 0| + |3 - 0| = 4, reachable.
Tower [2, 2, 4]: Manhattan distance = |2 - 0| + |2 - 0| = 4, reachable.
Tower [4, 4, 7]: Manhattan distance = |4 - 0| + |4 - 0| = 8, not reachable.
Among the reachable towers, the maximum quality factor is 4. Both [1, 3] and [2, 2] have the same quality, so the lexicographically smaller coordinate is [1, 3].

Example 3:

Input: towers = [[5,6,8], [0,3,5]], center = [1,2], radius = 1

Output: [-1,-1]

Explanation:

Tower [5, 6, 8]: Manhattan distance = |5 - 1| + |6 - 2| = 8, not reachable.
Tower [0, 3, 5]: Manhattan distance = |0 - 1| + |3 - 2| = 2, not reachable.
No tower is reachable within the given radius, so [-1, -1] is returned.
